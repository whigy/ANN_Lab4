* t5_1Error: attractor & convergence

* t5_3Energy: Energy of Hopfield

  Four tasks included:
  1. Energy of simple patterns (t5_3Energy)
  2. Energy of picture patterns (t5_3Energy_pic)
  3. Random weight of simple patterns (t5_3Rand_weight)
  4. Random weight of picture patterns (t5_3Pic_rand_weight)

* t5_4Distortion: Distortion Resistance
    1. [t5_4Distortion.m] plot the figures through noise = [0, 0.2, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.8, 1]
    2. [t5_4Distortion_update.m] draw the line chart of noise tolarance

* t5_5Capacity: Capacity
